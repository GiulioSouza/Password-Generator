This project explores some concepts of programming logic and puts the knowledge of HTML and CSS to practice.
I did it from one of the projects of the "Front-end Training course - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and +" that I'm doing. 
I decided to bring it here because I thought it was innovative and different from other projects I've done.
